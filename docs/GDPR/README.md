# Personal data protection and privacy
::: warning
Work in progress
:::

A platform made to collect and publish court decisions has to be designed with privacy in mind.

Finding a balance between the right to be informed and the right to be forgotten, a just proportion between data to be published or hidden in one way or another, be it by anonymisation or pseudonymisation, is a complex task.

## Collecting, publishing and moderating
::: info Proof of concept
Content below is hypothetical, the beginning of a reflexion about how the collection and publication of court decisions could be implemented in a safe an respectful manner.
:::

The data collection part of the platform assists the user in the process of removing protected information from the texts to be uploading. During this process, before receiving the user's confirmation, no data or content will be stored.

The users will have a choice of multiple algorithms and methods to remove protected information, and will be able to mend the resulting text, be it by increasing or decreasing the amount of removed information.

Multiple options exist as to what could be possible after the first upload:
- a unprotected copy is stored as to allow for improved algorithms to update the published text
- a protected, encrypted copy is stored as to allow the uploading user (and only the uploading user) to update the published text
- no copy is stored on the platform
In any of these cases, the administrators of the platform keep the possibility to increase the removal of protected information on any protected document, up to removing the document from the search index.

Once published, the user interface will offer the necessary functionality allowing end users to flag and signal problematic content (allowing administrators or moderators to act).

Optionally, uploading users could specify time periods after which the anonymisation or pseudonymisation of the decision would increase.

## Glossary
anonymisation
: process by which personal data is irreversibly altered in such a way that a data subject can no longer be identified directly or indirectly, either by the data controller alone or in collaboration with any other party.

pseudonymisation
: de-identification procedure by which personally identifiable information fields within a data record are replaced by one or more artificial identifiers, or pseudonyms. A single pseudonym for each replaced field or collection of replaced fields makes the data record less identifiable while remaining suitable for data analysis and data processing.

moderator
: user with special powers able to remove protected information from published documents, or remove them entirely.
